#### what is node JS 
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side. Node.js is designed to handle a large number of concurrent connections, making it a popular choice for real-time web applications.

Two different ways to execute node code:
**REPL**
- Great for testing and experimenting with code
- Execute as you write
**Execute Files**
- Used for real apps
- predictable sequence of steps

#### REPL
The REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) in Node.js is an interactive shell environment that allows users to execute JavaScript code and receive immediate feedback. It's a built-in tool that comes with Node.js and provides a way to test code snippets.
- **Read:** It reads the JavaScript code entered by the user.
- **Eval:** It evaluates the code and executes it.
- **Print:** It prints the result of the execution to the console.
- **Loop:** It loops back to the read step, waiting for the next input.
